# Our story 
![Alon 21.08.2018](https://github.com/maydanw/GFER/master/Images/IMG-20180821.jpg "Alon")
This cute baby name is Alon and he is 9 months old in the picture which was taken in August 2018. When Alon was 3 months old congenital cataracts were suddenly forming in his eyes and urgent surgeries were required. Along with the surgeries metabolic and genetics tests (Exome) where performed. Alone's diagnostic had shown a high level of lactate and elevated liver enzymes along with few other anomalies but no clear explanation for the cataract's cause. 
  
It was only two months later that the Exome results had arrived with devastating news.  
Alone has a mutation in a gene called GFER. It is a single nucleotide (a letter in the DNA) change in each of his gene's copies. One is a stop codon (c.502C>T; p.Gln168*), while the other (c.421C>T; p.Pro141Ser) drastically changes the resulted protein structure.  
The disease has only 9 documented cases. All of the documented children suffer from a loss of mental abilities (neurodegenerative), severe muscle weakness (myopathy) and many other horrible symptoms. What is more, the disease is a progressive mitochondrial disease (meaning their state deteriorates over time) and a healthy child now is not an indication what his state will be in the next year, month, week or day. As it is an ultra-rare disease, there is no money or interest in it and no one had even tried to develop a treatment for it.

I was sitting there, in that meeting, hearing the news with a single mantra looping in my mind: "Hear, Learn, Act". As we came back home, my wife and I, swore an oath:
**This will not be his future! **

Since then, both of us left our jobs and set on a long track dedicating our time and efforts to this cause.
 
I do hope to report good news from time to time.

# What is GFER
---
## General  
> Protein: FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase ALR  
> Gene: GFER
>  
>**Isoform 1:**
 FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase that regenerates the redox-active disulfide bonds in CHCHD4/MIA40, a chaperone 
essential for disulfide bond formation and protein folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The reduced form 
of CHCHD4/MIA40 forms a transient intermolecular disulfide bridge with GFER/ERV1, resulting in regeneration of the 
essential disulfide bonds in CHCHD4/MIA40, while GFER/ERV1 becomes re-oxidized by donating electrons to cytochrome c or 
molecular oxygen   
**Isoform 2:**  
May act as an autocrine hepatotrophic growth factor promoting liver regeneration.
