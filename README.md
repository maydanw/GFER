# GFER
---
## General  
> Protein: FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase ALR  
> Gene: GFER
>  
>**Isoform 1:**
 FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase that regenerates the redox-active disulfide bonds in CHCHD4/MIA40, a chaperone 
essential for disulfide bond formation and protein folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The reduced form 
of CHCHD4/MIA40 forms a transient intermolecular disulfide bridge with GFER/ERV1, resulting in regeneration of the 
essential disulfide bonds in CHCHD4/MIA40, while GFER/ERV1 becomes re-oxidized by donating electrons to cytochrome c or 
molecular oxygen   
**Isoform 2:**  
May act as an autocrine hepatotrophic growth factor promoting liver regeneration.
